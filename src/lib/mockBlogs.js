      </div>

      <h2>Advantages Over Traditional Systems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Extended Range:</strong> Hydrogen systems can provide 5+ hours of flight time</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Refueling:</strong> Refuel in minutes instead of hours</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Emissions:</strong> Only water vapor is produced</li>
        <li><strong>High Payload Capacity:</strong> Up to 400kg payload capability</li>
      </ul>
